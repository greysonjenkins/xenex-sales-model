Its focus is orimarily on quick visualizaion, summaries, and statistics, as opposed to a completed deliverable product. To keep dataset manipulation separate from analysis and modeling, all changes to the datast will be made in this notebook.\n","\n","For this sales predictive model, the target/predicted variable will be the opportunity stage which indicates whether an opportunity was won or lost.
